The most notable thing here is that hill-climbing blows the genetic algorithm out of the water. On my first implementation of hill-climbing, I got a path length of 6870.24, while with the plain genetic algorithm I could never even get close to 10,000. I have left the original implementation of the genetic algorithm, as well as various hill-climbing heuristics, in climb_chromosome.cc.
